# Plant Disease Prediction App

## Overview

The Plant Disease Prediction App is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to upload images of plant leaves to identify potential diseases. This app utilizes deep learning models to analyze the uploaded images and provide predictions based on the visual characteristics of the leaves. The app also incorporates the OpenVINO library to optimize the model for inference, improving performance and enabling deployment on various hardware platforms.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of plant leaves.
- **Disease Prediction**: The app provides predictions of potential diseases based on the uploaded images.
- **Optimized Inference**: The app leverages the OpenVINO toolkit to enhance model inference speed and efficiency.
